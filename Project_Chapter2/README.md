This is a project from "Operating Systems: Concept" version 10 Chapter2.

File "Makefile" is specific for "seconds". If you are to use it for "jiffies", just change "seconds" in the first line to "jiffies".

After that, you can insert the mode into the operating system, and call the corresponding process.

You may refer to "EI338_Lab_Report_Chapter2" for detailed process.
